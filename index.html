            Describe how your dashboard answers the questions presented. You don't have to address every question
            directly,
            but should at a high level address the main questions. (10 points)
        </h3>

        <body>
            My first graph answers the first question by looking at the number of games played in the last 10 years.
            This directly answers my boss's first question, which asked how many games were played in the past 5 years
            at least.
            <br>
            My second graph answers the third questions by looking at the number of world cup games won in the last two
            world cups by any country. I chose the metric of number of games won in a FIFA World Cup; this is pretty
            okay metric, as the better you do in a World Cup, the more games you get to play. Thus, I believe this is a
            good metric for us to determine who did well, as win percentage may be misleading.
            <br>
            The second question remains unanswered and is a mystery...I would have liked to create a map graph showing
            the top 10 winningest countries out of the last 20 years by win percentage, but alas ran out of time.

            List 3 reasons why D3 was helpful and improved your visualization (6 points)
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>D3 made it really easy for me to create a scale of colors to improve the aesthetics of my graph</li>
            <li>D3, using the scaleBand and scaleLinear functions allowed me to create scales for my graph axes without
                calculating manually what they should be</li>
            <li>D3 allowed me to easily create axis labels and transform them as I pleased — if I had manually drawn
                them, I would have to recalculate them if my data changed </li>
        </ol>

            List 3 reasons why D3 would not be the best tool for creating a visualization (6 points)
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>D3 could be difficult for non-technical people to understand and thus pose a high barrier of entry</li>
            <li>D3 can only be used in JavaScript, so cannot be easily transferred to other mediums like print</li>
            <li>D3 is not as customizable as programs like Adobe Illustrator, where every possible attribute can be
                changed exactly as you please very easily</li>
            <li>D3 doesn't always support older browsers</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>
            Evaluate the accessibility of your dashboard based on the readings in the “Before you begin” section. What
            kinds of users might find this dashboard accessible and who might have more difficulty? What additional
            actions might you take to make this dashboard more accessible to all audiences? Your response should refer
            to at least one of the readings and be about 1 paragraph.
        </h3>

        <body>
            My dashboard accessibility is quite horrendous. First, there are no tooltips. Second, the text on some of
            the axes are quite small. However, things are well segmented in to structural elements, which makes it easy
            to navigate for screen readers. There are also no audio components, which make it very accessible to the
            deaf. Additionally, there is a small animation which may be distracting to those with ADHD (as mentioned in
            the article "Why Accessibility Is at the Heart of Data Visualization") I could add tool
            tips and remove animations, as well as making the fonts larger.

        <h3>
            Reflect on the stages of your design and implementation process when you could have taken steps to make your
            dashboard more accessible to all audiences. What are some factors that kept you from taking these steps? (a
            few sentences)
        </h3>

        <body>
            I should have spent a lot more time planning. To be honest, that was definitely the biggest downfall.
            Probably my poor mental health and lack of motivation in school during a global pandemic stopped me from
            doing my best on this assignment, including adding more features that are accessible to everyone. However,
            since the site is relatively simple, I believe it's also mostly accessible.
